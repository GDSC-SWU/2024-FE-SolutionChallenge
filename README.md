🚩**Problem**
1. Earned wages
   This occurs due to wage uncertainty that exists in various national labor markets, but even if workers want to see if it is appropriate, there is no information available to refer to.
2. Unequal pay
   When economic activities are carried out in a foreign country rather than in one's own home country, the monetary standard is different, making it difficult to determine whether wages are equal.
3. Unequal consumption
   When economic activities are carried out in a foreign country rather than in one's own home country, the standard of currency differs, making it difficult to judge whether consumption is equal or not.
<br/>
<br/>

❓**How to solve**

You can use FairEconomy's FE.
Provide equal consumption and income standards based on the nation.

Although there may be underlying causes for wage (income) disparities and unequal economic activities, we focused on the lack of information.
This will provide equal consumption and income standards based on the nation.
(Ex: If user A is Chinese, compare public transportation costs in China with public transportation costs in South Korea and provide an approximate standard for price comparison)
This will enable equal economic activities for immigrants and temporary residents overseas, and will also make it possible to provide high-quality employment for workers.

Recommended for immigrants, people on working holidays, and people who are concerned about whether they are in a working environment where they can receive adequate wages.
